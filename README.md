# Lilypond Mobile Building Experiment

This forked respository is an experiment for building Lilypond as [Nodejs C++ addon](https://nodejs.org/api/addons.html), and on mobile platform of Android & iOS.

## CMake building

[cmake/lilypond.cmake](cmake/lilypond.cmake) is the platform-independent CMake module for main library, which can be included by platform-specific `CMakeLists.txt` file.

## Module dependencies

## Lilypond C++ APIs Proposal

```cpp
void initialize (const std::string& init_path);
int engrave (const std::string& ly_code, const EngraveOptions& options);
```

Complete definition is at: [lilypond-ex.hh](node-addon/include/lilypond-ex.hh).

sheet music possible.  It brings the aesthetics of traditionally engraved music
to computer printouts.  LilyPond is free software and part of the
[GNU Project](https://www.gnu.org).

## Overview

LilyPond is a text-based music notation program.  It produces elegant, balanced
scores, the look of which was inspired by classical hand-engraving.  LilyPond
is cross-platform and extremely flexible thanks to its extension system written
in the Scheme programming language.

More about LilyPond in our [Introduction](https://lilypond.org/introduction).


## Building and installing

Binaries are available at https://lilypond.org/download.html

For compiling LilyPond yourself, refer to
[Compiling](https://lilypond.org/doc/latest/Documentation/contributor/compiling)
in the Contributor's Guide.


## Versioning

LilyPond uses a versioning scheme that easily identifies stable and
development releases.  In a version *x.y.z*, an even second number *y*
denotes a stable version.  For development versions, *y* is odd.


## Documentation

The manuals can be read online at https://lilypond.org/manuals

It is also possible to build the documentation locally: follow the instructions at
