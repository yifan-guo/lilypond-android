// This differs from std::round() in the handling of negative numbers:
// While std::round() rounds halfway cases away from zero, this function
// rounds them up (for historic reasons). As an example,
//   std::round(-7.5) = -8.0
//   round_halfway_up(-7.5) = -7.0
//
// This can apparently be relied upon at least when manually positioning
// ties (input/regression/tie-single-manual.ly). In the long run, these
// cases should be identified and taken care of individually. Keep this
// function (old name: my_round) for the time being, but DO NOT USE in
// newly written code.
